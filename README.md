Hello! I'm HajirAlsaddi and I'm passionate about diving into the world of data, analysis, and problem-solving. With a background in mathematics and a keen interest in analysis and comparison, I thrive on uncovering insights that drive informed decision-making.
I've equipped myself with a range of skills, including data analysis, statistical analysis, SQL, data visualization, and the art of data storytelling. My experience extends to technical writing, enabling me to communicate complex findings effectively.
I've honed my abilities through various courses, including Data Representation and Visualization in Tableau, a Business Analytics Nanodegree, and specialized training in using data for effective policy marketing.
In my projects, I've applied these skills in diverse contexts. From conducting sales analysis using SQL to crafting compelling data visualizations with Tableau, I've consistently demonstrated my ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data. Additionally, my work on projects like the extraction of cellulose from palm waste for bioplastic production underscores my commitment to leveraging data for innovative solutions
I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate and tackle new challenges in the realm of data analysis and beyond. Let's connect and explore how we can make an impact together!
